* Upstart

  A birth of an idea that traditional lending practices were not effective nor did they paint a true financial picture of the borrower. With the limited tools lenders have to vet a borrower they would still endup with "bad loans". Now with better AI tools and factors the vetting process will not only match a borrower with the right lender but the process will not effect the borrower credit score.
Upstart stated off with private investors Lanna Adair and The Blueshirt Group. After more that 10 years of private investors they are now on NASDAQ: UPST. Just announced the closing of its initial pubic offering of its common stock at a price of $20.00 per share.
